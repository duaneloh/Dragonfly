## Quick start  
### Spawn a reconstruction directory
Type in the topmost directory:
	```
	./init_new_recon.py
	```.
This makes the binaries needed for the package and links them into a new reconstruction directory named "recon_nnnn". For help on customizing this setup script (e.g. custom folder name or counter):
	```
	./init_new_recon.py -h
	```.

### Configure experiment
Go to your newly created recon directory
	```
	cd recon_nnnn
	```.
Change the experiment parameters in config.ini to your liking. 
Here are some things that you might like to change:
- ***in_pdb_file***: relative path to your own PDB file
- scattering setup (detector distance, photon wavelength, etc)
	* parameter unit:
		* ***detd*** (detector distance): millimeter
		* ***lambda*** (photon wavelength): Angstrom
		* ***detsize*** (linear size of detector): pixels in integer
		* ***pixsize***: millimeter
		* ***stoprad*** (radius of beamstop): pixels in float
- ***num_data***: the number of diffraction patterns
- ***fluence***: the incident beam intensity in photons per micron squared
- ***log_file***: name of log file

When ready to start creating synthetic data, type:
	```
	./sim_setup.py
	```.
Again, you can get help to customize this using the command:
	```
	./sim_setup.py -h
	```.

### Start your EMC reconstruction
***You can use the convenience script ```run_emc.py``` that we provided to start the reconstruction:***
Typing 
	```
	./run_emc.py
	```,
will start the reconstruction with the default of 10 iterations.
You can continue to refine the last reconstruction by typing 
	```
	./run_emc.py -r
	```,
or if you wanted to increase the quaternion sampling by one, 
	```
	./run_emc.py -R
	```.

If you have enough processors to do an MPI reconstruction:
	```
	./run_emc.py -m <number of MPI processes>
	```.
For more information, type:
	```
	./run_emc.py -h
	```.


***Or you can start a single process reconstruction in the recon directory with more control way:***
	```
	./emc <num_iterations> <path to config file> [threads per process]
	```,
where ```<necessary arguments>``` and ```[optional arguments]```. The default number of threads per process is defined by the system parameter OMP_NUM_THREADS.
By default, the intermediate output of the reconstruction is stored in the recon directory's data subdirectory.

To spawn multiple MPI reconstructions from your recon directory:
	```
	mpirun -n <num_mpi_processes> ./emc <num_iterations> <path to config file> [threads per process]
	```.
By default, images from the reconstruction that are generated by this script are saved to the data/images subdirectory.

### Monitor the progress of your reconstruction 
In the recon directory type:
	```
	./autoplot.py
	```.
Checking the "keep checking" box will automagically look for new reconstructed 3D volumes in the default data directories.

### Additional information
For a more verbose, and maybe informative, view of the underlying setup and reconstruction processes, look at the log files ```recon.log``` and ```EMC.log``` files respectively.

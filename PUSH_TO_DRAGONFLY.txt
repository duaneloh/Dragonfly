How to push new versions of EMC up to the Dragonfly repo?

#Clone repo from EMC
git clone git@github.com:duaneloh/EMC

#Switch remotes from EMC to Dragonfly
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:duaneloh/Dragonfly

#Replace master branch with another that has no commit history
git checkout --orphan newbranch
git add -A
git commit -m "Committing version A.B.C"

#Delete master branch, and rename newbranch as master
git branch -D master
git branch -m master

#Then push to new branch on Dragonfly
git push origin master:Version_A.B.C.

#Have to make the default branch on Dragonfly the new version.

Pull request method:

1. Create a temporary local clone of EMC
	$ git clone git@github.com:duaneloh/EMC.git temp_repo
	$ cd temp_repo

2. Create a fork of duaneloh/Dragonfly into your personal account by going to
   the website and clicking 'Fork' in the top right corner.

3. Add your personal fork as a remote and pull from its master branch
	$ git remote add fork git@github.com:<username>/Dragonfly.git
	$ git pull fork master

4. You will get a set of conflicts for all the files you have changed. You
   want to accept the local version for these files. So, for each of the 
   conflicted files do
	$ git checkout --ours <filename>
   You can also do it for all files by grep-ing for the '<<<<<' string.

5. Once this is done, commit your changes with a version number message. After
   that, push to your personal fork.
	$ git push fork master

6. Now on the main Dragonfly webpage, open a pull request (across forks) and
   describe your changes in detail. You can then notify people to review if you
   want and then squash the commits and accept the changes.

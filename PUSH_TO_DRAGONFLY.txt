How to push new versions of EMC up to the Dragonfly repo?

#Clone repo from EMC
git clone git@github.com:duaneloh/EMC

#Switch remotes from EMC to Dragonfly
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:duaneloh/Dragonfly

#Replace master branch with another that has no commit history
git checkout --orphan newbranch
git add -A
git commit -m "Committing version A.B.C"

#Delete master branch, and rename newbranch as master
git branch -D master
git branch -m master

#Then push to new branch on Dragonfly
git push origin master:Version_A.B.C.

#Have to make the default branch on Dragonfly the new version.
